# Setup Instructions

## 1. Local Setup

Clone this repository and install all required dependencies using `npm install`

## 2. Create config.json File

A config.json file present in the same location as the index.js file contains all the bot secret configurations and hence not available publicly on this repo. The format is given below. You need to create one and update the following: `guildId`, `clientIdTest`, `tokenTest`, `mongourlTest`

```json
{
    "guildId": "testing_server_id",
    "clientIdTest": "testing_bot_id",
    "clientIdProd": "production_bot_id",
    "tokenTest": "testing_bot_token",
    "tokenProd": "production_bot_token",
    "mongourlTest": "testing_mongodb_url/db",
    "mongourlProd": "production_mongodb_url/db",
    "isProduction": false
}
```


## 3. Create Discord Bot Account

1. Open the [Discord Developers Portal.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Switch to `Applications` tab and then click the `New Application` button, enter your desired bot name and click `Create`.

3. Switch to `Bot` tab, click `Add Bot`, and confirm `Yes, do it!`. Click on `Reset Token` and copy the new token (this is the `tokenTest` for config.json file).

4. Switch to `General Information` tab, copy the `APPLICATION ID` (this is the `clientIdTest` for config.json file), and invite the bot to your test server using the below link by replacing the `{APPLICATION_ID_HERE}`
    ```sh
    https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={APPLICATION_ID_HERE}&permissions=268435456&scope=bot%20applications.commands
    ```
5. From the dropdown, you need to choose an existing server from the options.

6. But if there are none to be selected from the dropdown, click on [ Discord Website. ](https://discord.com/) to login or create a discord account. Then Click on the `+` tab on the left menu to add a New Server.

7. Switch back to the link below and refresh, from the dropdown select the newly created server.

    ```sh
        https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={APPLICATION_ID_HERE}&permissions=268435456&scope=bot%20applications.commands
    ```

## 4. Other config.json Parameters

1. When you open your test server on discord, the link will be in the below format. Get the `guildId` from here.

    ```
    https://discord.com/channels/guildId/channelId
    ```

2. Setup MongoDB server locally or create a MongoDB Atlas account, and get the connection url (look this up on YouTube as it is beyond the scope of this setup instruction). This will be the `mongourlTest`.

## 5. Finishing Up

1. Deploy the slash commands once using `node deploy.js`, you will see this `Successfully registered server application commands!` if successful.

2. Run the bot using `node index.js` this shows up if successful 
    ```
        Connected to MongoDB.
        Notifications loop started.
        Daily problem loop started.
        Scraping loop started.
        Bot is online.
    ```

3. Go back to your discord account, on the chat box type the `/` and choose different files from the commands folder in VS code
