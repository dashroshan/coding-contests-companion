# Coding Contests Companion Bot - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 8 October 2024

At **Coding Contests Companion Bot** ("Bot"), we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect it when you use the Bot in your Discord server. By using the Bot, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. **Information We Collect**

We collect only the minimal information necessary to provide the services of the Bot. The types of information we may collect include:

### 1.1 **Server Information**
- **Server ID**: Used to uniquely identify and interact with your Discord server.
- **Channel IDs**: Used to determine where to send messages (e.g., contest notifications or daily coding problems).
- **Roles**: The Bot accesses roles to allow users to self-assign a role for coding contest notifications.
- **Messages**: The Bot sends messages to the server channels (e.g., contest reminders, daily challenges), but it does not collect or store any message content from your server.

### 1.2 **User Information**
- **User ID**: The Bot may interact with individual user IDs for role management (i.e., when users opt into receiving notifications for coding contests).
- **User interactions**: Information such as when a user interacts with the Bot, such as adding or removing roles, is logged temporarily for operational purposes.

## 2. **How We Use Your Information**

We use the information collected to provide and enhance the Bot’s functionality, including but not limited to:
- Displaying ongoing and upcoming coding contests.
- Sending notifications to users who have opted into contest reminders.
- Delivering daily coding challenges from LeetCode.

### 2.1 **Non-Personal Data**
We may aggregate and anonymize certain non-personal data to analyze Bot usage trends and improve the service.

## 3. **Data Storage and Retention**

### 3.1 **Storage**
The Bot stores minimal data for operational purposes only. This includes basic server configurations like channel IDs for posting updates and user role information. We do not store personal message content or sensitive information.

### 3.2 **Retention**
We retain the information collected for as long as it is necessary to provide the Bot’s services. If the Bot is removed from your server, all associated data will be deleted. 

## 4. **Data Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your information with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:
- **Service Providers**: We may share information with trusted third-party services that assist in hosting or improving the Bot. These service providers are bound by confidentiality agreements.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or a valid legal request (e.g., a subpoena or court order).

## 5. **Security**

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the data collected from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. **Children's Privacy**

The Bot is intended for use by Discord users who are 13 years of age or older, or the minimum age required by your local jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will promptly delete such information.

## 7. **Your Rights and Choices**

### 7.1 **Access and Deletion**
As a Discord server owner or user, you have the right to:
- **Access**: Request a copy of the information we collect about your server.
- **Delete**: Remove the Bot from your server to erase all associated data.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details provided below.

### 7.2 **Opting Out of Notifications**
Users can self-assign or remove roles to opt in or out of contest notifications. Server administrators also have the ability to manage Bot permissions and roles to control how the Bot interacts with users.

## 8. **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this document. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically to stay informed about any changes.
